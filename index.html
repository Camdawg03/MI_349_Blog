<p>I'm going to start this off by saying yes, I am wearing my work shirt and I did take this photo while I was on my lunch. In the fitness community, talking about leg day can be a touchy subject for some. Personally, I do not like it. When I first started working out, I did lots of squatting and deadlifting, both movements in SBD aka standard powerlifting movements. What I come to realize is doing these movements, especially squatting, wears me out a ton. With my fitness goal also being mainly to put on size and not strength, it was not the most optimal option either To combat this issue, I decided to move to smith machine heel elevated squats. Using the smith machine means I can make the exercise almost soley quad focus and using a plate to elevate my heels also makes the tension on the quads increase. I also started to do this and leg presses as my big compound movements. Another exersice that allows stability, being able to place your feet anywhere means you can basically work every leg muscle, including calves if you really wanted to. By switching from regular squat/deadlift to these movements, I've been able to be more motivated and focus on leg days more efficiently</p>
