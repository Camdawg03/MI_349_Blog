<p>I'm going to start this off by saying yes, I am wearing my work shirt and I did take this photo while I was on my lunch. In the fitness community, talking about leg day can be a touchy subject for some. Personally, I do not like it. When I first started working out, I did lots of squatting and deadlifting, both movements in SBD aka standard powerlifting movements. What I come to realize is doing these movements, especially squatting, wears me out a ton. With my fitness goal also being mainly to put on size and not strength, it was not the most optimal option either To combat this issue, I decided to move to smith machine heel elevated squats. Using the smith machine means I can make the exercise almost soley quad focus and using a plate to elevate my heels also makes the tension on the quads increase. I also started to do this and leg presses as my big compound movements. Another exersice that allows stability, being able to place your feet anywhere means you can basically work every leg muscle, including calves if you really wanted to. By switching from regular squat/deadlift to these movements, I've been able to be more motivated and focus on leg days more efficiently. </p>

        <h3>How to Maximize Bicep Growth</h3>

    <p>Ah biceps, I think they're one of my favorite muscles to train. The mind-muscle connection is just too good not to like. Although I have visible biceps now, I was not always like this. One core memory that I have is when I first started working out, my ex girlfriend pointed out how I had no biceps, and she was extremely muscular so this got to me. It took me up until a few months ago to figure out how to effectively train them. The key you ask? Control and form. You're probably thinking "Well yeah that's for all exercises Camdyn duh" no no no, it's so important for biceps that I have to say it. The one thing I see so many people doing when performing curls is 1. Not controlling both the eccentric and concentric, aka up and down movements and 2. swinging their body or using other muscles to help get the weight up. My tip? Keep your elbows tucked and watch your arms to make sure you're not swinging the weight. If it's too heavy, then lower the weight and focus on form, nobody is going to care. Form over ego lifting you know? When it comes to the eccentric and concentric movements, I reccomend curling the weight up and then slowly lowering it down for about 2-3 seconds to really feel a burn. These controls are especially great on spider curls. I could go on and on about this, but these are my few quick tips for this blog!</p>
