 <p> Hello! My name is Camdyn and I am currently training and dieting with the goal to gain muscle while living in a single dorm at university! Without having easy access to a kitchen, it's hard to recgnize and find foods that are not only low calorie, but also high in protein. On top of this, it is hard for beginners to find workouts and routines that are effective. That's where I come in. My goal for this blog is to share my experiences and tips with others who are in a similar situation as mine to help them achieve their fitness goals.</p>

 <h3>My Favorite Exercises</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>Leg Press</li>
    <li>Lateral Raises</li>
    <li>DB Chest Press</li>
    <li>Hammer Curls</li>
 </ul>
